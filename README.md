# Attendance Tracker

The Student Attendance Tracker is a simple Java console application that utilizes a hash-based structure to efficiently manage attendance records for students. The application is designed for use in classrooms or small educational setups where attendance needs to be tracked quickly and accurately.

What It Can Do:

1.Mark Attendance: Record the presence of a student by entering their ID and name.

2.Check Attendance: Verify if a specific student has been marked present.

3.Display Attendance: View the list of all students marked as present along with their IDs.

4.Efficient Storage: Leverages a HashMap to ensure fast lookups and efficient management of attendance records.

5.Exit the System: Users can choose to exit the application at any time, closing the program gracefully.

Why I Made This Application:

As a BSIT student, I understand the need for tools that streamline administrative tasks like attendance tracking. I developed this application to demonstrate how hashing structures can solve real-world problems efficiently. This tracker saves time and effort, ensuring a smooth attendance management process.
